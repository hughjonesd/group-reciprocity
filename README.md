# group-reciprocity
Source and data for the paper "Humans reciprocate by discriminating against group peers"

* This is just a one-off github dump (we could have used Dropbox but you get a nicer README :-) )

* We haven't cleaned up much
  - Apologies if there are any bad comments about reviewers :-)

* The paper is in the `Paper` subfolder, you can recreate it from the Rmd file

* You'll need to edit a few file paths and download the appropriate R libraries   
  - Everything should work as of April 2018

* Data is in `data` and is anonymous
