\begin{abstract}
Cycles of intergroup revenge appear in large scale conflicts. We experimentally
test the hypothesis that humans practice group-based reciprocity: if someone
harms or helps them, they harm or help other members of that person's group.
Subjects played a trust game, then allocated money between other people. Senders
whose partners returned more in the trust game gave more to that partner's group
members. The effect was about half as large as the effect of direct reciprocity.
Receivers' allocations to group members were not affected by their partners’ 
play in the trust game, suggesting that group reciprocity was only triggered when the
partner's intentions were unequivocal.

%Q\section*{Significance statement}

%Sometimes humans take revenge, not on the person who harmed them, but on other people from that person's group. This can lead to intergroup conflict and violence. We ran a laboratory experiment showing that this happens. We found that humans only take revenge on groups when the original person's act was deliberate and unequivocal. Laboratory experiments like these can help us to understand the psychology behind intergroup revenge.

\section{Introduction}

Human society is organized in groups, including families, clans, firms and nations. This
structure is reflected in individual behaviour and cognition. Humans identify
with their ingroup and are altruistic and prosocial towards ingroup members;
towards outgroup members, they display stereotyping and prejudice
\citep{tajfel1979integrative,yamagishi2000thegroup,balliet2014ingroup,DeDreu2014,chen2009group,chen2011potential}.
Group structure provides the backdrop for intergroup conflict---from economic
and political competition to inter-ethnic violence and war---which is pervasive
in the species \citep{world_bank_world_2011}.

Intergroup conflicts often follow a tit-for-tat logic, in which one group's
violence leads to revenge from the other side
\citep{horowitz2001thedeadly,horowitz1985ethnicgroups,chagnon1988lifehistories,haushofer_both_2010,shayo2010judicial}.
This suggests that humans practice intergroup \emph{reciprocity}. Reciprocity is
a well-known mechanism that may underlie the evolution of cooperation
\citep{nowak2006five,nowak2012evolving}. While in direct reciprocity,
individuals help those who have helped them in the past (and similarly for
harm), in indirect reciprocity, individuals help or harm other people than those
who have helped them.  Indirect reciprocity comes in two flavours:
\emph{downstream} reciprocity follows the maxim `do unto thy neighbour as they
have done to others', whereas \emph{upstream} reciprocity follows the maxim `do
unto thy neighbour as others have done unto you'. 
%There is evidence for group-based downstream reciprocity: individuals punish norm violators more if these harm a member of their own group \citep{bernhard2006group,bernhard2006parochial}. 

In this paper we examine
group-based upstream reciprocity, or \emph{group reciprocity}. That is, an
individual who is harmed (helped) by a member of an outgroup becomes more likely
to harm (help) others from that group.  Whereas group-based downstream
reciprocity \citep{bernhard2006group,bernhard2006parochial} follows the maxim
`do unto others as they have done to members of \emph{my} tribe', group-based
upstream reciprocity follows the maxim `do unto others as members of
\emph{their} tribe have done to me' (Figure~\ref{fig:illustration}).

There are three kinds of theories of the evolution of intergroup violence. Cultural theories argue there is
no innate tendency to intergroup aggression. Parochial altruism theories argue that intergroup violence was a driver of
within-group altruism, via group selection; as a result, intergroup violence can involve self-sacrifice for one's group
members \citep{choi2007coevolution,bowles2009did}. The "chimpanzee model", by contrast, argues that early humans, like 
chimpanzees, only attack when odds are very favourable; thus conflict is sufficiently motivated by self-interest 
\citep{wrangham2012intergroup}. This is supported by evidence that both hunter-gatherers and chimpanzees are rarely
wounded when they attack. A puzzle for the chimpanzee model, however, is that intergroup conflict among
hunter-gatherers appears rare \citep{fry2013lethal}. 

Paradoxically, group reciprocity could explain the rarity of conflict among hunter-gatherers.
When there is group reciprocity, someone who harms an outgroup member brings retaliation on his
own group. This gives his group members an incentive to maintain peace \citep{boehm1984blood}. By contrast, while 
chimpanzees do practice retaliation and reconciliation among alliances within the band, they 
do not reciprocate towards other bands. Instead, they always attack stranger chimpanzees, when it is safe to do so.  The 
risk of being attacked forces chimps to avoid territory bordering other bands, which limits their available space for 
foraging \citep{wilson2003intergroup}. Thus, the evolution of group reciprocity could have benefited humans by allowing
them to range over wider areas and to have more extensive contacts with outgroups. \citet{kelly2000warless} argues that 
group reciprocity ("social substitutability") is more important when there is a 
strong political clan organization; however, hunter-gatherers do sometimes practice group reciprocity 
\citep{boehm2012ancestral}.

While group reciprocity can benefit the group, to evolve it must increase individual fitness. In the appendix we 
run simulations showing how this can happen. Individuals are divided into groups of size $n$. They are either selfish 
or group reciprocal types. Each 
period, each individual has an opportunity to help or harm a randomly chosen outgroup member. Helping has a 
fitness cost $c$ while providing a benefit $b$ to the target. Selfish types never help, while group reciprocators
help in the first instance, and then help with a probability proportional to the number of times they have been
helped before by a member of the outgroup. We show that group reciprocity can evolve to fixation if $b/c > n$; that is,
it is a public good within the group. The high $b/c$ ratio required for group reciprocity to evolve fits the
"chimpanzee model" of conflict where attacks are only launched if it is low risk. This may also explain 
why most salient examples of group reciprocity are seen in the "negative" domain of harm and conflict. When $b/c$ is high,
hurting or refraining from helping is a "nasty" thing to do, since it imposes a large loss on the target for a 
small gain to oneself.

Group reciprocity provides an evolutionary basis for outgroup stereotyping. Upstream group reciprocity
has different cognitive requirements from related phenomena. While ingroup altruism and group-based downstream
reciprocity require people to differentiate their own group from outsiders---``us'' from ``them''---upstream group 
reciprocity requires them to differentiate between different outgroups---between ``them and them''---and to
keep a mental account of outgroups' reputation.

We ran a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that people reciprocate towards groups. Although field observations from conflict are highly suggestive, they are loaded with individual and group context and history. Observing group reciprocity under controlled laboratory conditions with artifical groups identifies group reciprocity as an innate human tendency.
Cleanly identifying group reciprocity requires controlling for three confounds: individual level reciprocity, e.g. if subjects' actions affect an entire group including the original actor who helped or harmed them; generalized reciprocity, where subjects reciprocate not specifically towards the original actor’s group, but towards other people in general; and strategic interactions, where apparent reciprocity is driven by reputation-building. 
our experiment fulfils all three: subjects can differentiate the original actor from his or her group members, they interact both with these group members and with members of other groups, and we minimize strategic concerns by not giving feedback about subjects' actions.

%While previous work has not satisfied all three conditions simultaneously \citep{gaertner2008whenrejection,stenstrom2008theroles,hugh-jones2013intergroup}, 

While previous studies looked at retaliation towards groups, this retaliation does not necessarily reflect group reciprocity as defined here. \citet{gaertner2008whenrejection} found that rejection by one group member leads to more hostility towards the group when the group is perceived as a unified entity. Since hostility was directed towards the whole group, individual and group level reciprocity were confounded. Similarly, \citet{bohm2016makes} examine intergroup retaliation using the intergroup prisoner's
dilemma paradigm, but cannot distinguish between individual and group reciprocity.
\citet{stenstrom2008theroles} manipulated entitativity by making the original perpetrator (a political analyst) an official affiliate of the group (a presidential campaign). Thus, holding the group accountable for its member's action is justified without resorting to group reciprocity. In contrast, we look at how people reciprocate a clear individual act by one group member to an unrelated other group member, where group structure is minimal and free of existing social context. 


Our experimental set up was the following. After an initial group-formation stage, participants interacted in two strategic stages. The upstream action, in which the individual could be helped  or harmed by another person, was represented by a Trust Game (TG) \citep{berg1995trust}.  In this game, the Sender~(S) receives~150 money-equivalent tokens, and chooses how many of them to send to the Responder~(R). The amount sent is multiplied by a factor of~3, so that R receives between 0~and~450 tokens, of which he can send any number back to S. The TG enables us to model two types of interactions. Whereas R is clearly kind when returning money (and nasty when exploiting a generous proposer by keeping the received amount), S's intentions are equivocal. Sending money can be driven by selfish expectations of reciprocity, while not sending can be driven by caution. Thus, while all subjects experience helpful or harmful actions, only senders experience actions that clearly reflect their counterpart's preferences and intentions \citep{gunnthorsdottir2002using,kimbrough2015norms}.

The upstream action was followed by the reciprocal action, 
in which the individual could help others. We implemented this as an Allocation
Game in which subjects divided a fixed amount between two recipients.
In Direct Reciprocity rounds, the recipients included the TG partner;
in Group Reciprocity rounds, a member of the TG partner's group; and
in Ingroup Favoritism rounds, a member of the allocator's group.
The other recipient was always a member of a third, neutral, group.
Baseline rounds included two neutral recipients, to test whether the
TG experience leads to arbitrary discrimination in the absence of any reciprocal
or group motivations.

Our expectations were as follows. First, in Direct Reciprocity rounds, individuals' allocations to their TG partner
should positively covary with the amount the partner sent (or returned) in the Trust Game. This simply comes from
from the well-known theory of direct reciprocity. Second, if group reciprocity is present, then allocations to the TG partner's group member, in Group Reciprocity rounds, should also covary with the amount sent or returned by the TG partner.
We also measured participants' social value orientation \citep{van1999pursuit}. It is plausible that willingness to group-reciprocate should
be linked to other social preferences. We were not certain \emph{a priori} whether group reciprocity would be stronger
among selfish or among prosocial types. On the one hand, both prosociality and group reciprocity can be seen as actions
that benefit the group, by providing support to ingroup members or protecting it from outgroups. On the other hand,
negative reciprocity in general may be linked to spite \citep{johnstone2004evolution}. So we test a non-directional hypothesis here.

\section{Material and methods}
\label{sec:design}

Each session consisted of~24 participants, randomly allocated into six
\emph{teams} of four. Each participant was identified throughout the experiment
by team colour and individual number (1--4) within the team. At the beginning of
the experiment, participants were informed that the experiment had five distinct
stages, and that they might interact with the same people in different stages.
Specific instructions for each stage were distributed and read aloud at the
beginning of the stage. The five stages were a group formation stage, the TG
stage, the Allocation Game stage, a social value orientation elicitation stage
\citep*{murphy2011measuring} and a collectivism scale measurement stage
\citep*[adapted from the horizontal collectivism scale
in][]{Singelis1995horizontal}.

Following \citep{chen2009group}, we created group identity in the
first stage by allowing participants to consult each other by anonymous
chat while solving a simple task. Participants solved five Raven matrices
(see supplementary material). Each matrix was presented on screen
for 120~seconds, during which each participant could both send written
messages to the team and update her own answer. The final answer submitted
at the end of the 120~seconds determined payoffs, with 10~tokens
paid for each correct answer. To further boost group identity through
a common goal, team members each earned an additional bonus of 5~tokens
if all four team members answered correctly.

Next, participants were rematched into pairs to play the one-shot
TG. To facilitate understanding, participants played five practice
rounds, in which they entered decisions both as~S and as~R. In the
actual interaction, participants could see their TG partner's team
colour and individual number. 

The third stage Allocation Game consisted of six rounds. In each round, participants interacted
in groups of three. Individuals in each group were identified to each other by
team colour and number. Each round consisted of a random dictator game, as
follows. Each player in the group of three had to allocate 100~tokens within the
group. The allocator received a fixed 30~tokens, and could freely allocate the
remaining 70~tokens between the other two players. Previous research has found that
people do not harm, but refrain from helping negatively perceived outgroups
\citep{weisel2015ingroup}. Accordingly, we set the parameters of the game so
that, compared to the reference point of the allocator's own share, an equal
division benefits both other players. Table~\ref{tab:example} shows the matching scheme over the six rouds. Each participant was in the same group of three in one of the six rounds with a
member of her own team (\emph{ingroup} condition), in one round with her TG partner
(\emph{direct reciprocity} condition), and in two rounds with other members of the TG
partner's team (\emph{group reciprocity} condition). The remaining two rounds
served as the baseline condition. No feedback was provided between rounds. Stage payoffs were determined by one randomly chosen round of the six rounds, and
the allocation decision of one randomly chosen player in each group. Note that the matching is not independent. For example, if one player is in the direct reciprocity condition, then one other player
is in the direct reciprocity condition and the third player is in either the baseline or group
reciprocity condition.

\end{table}

The fourth stage implemented the slider measure of social value orientation
\citep*{murphy2011measuring,crosetto2012flexible}, in which participants
choose nine allocations between themselves and another person. For
consistency with the previous stages, the team identity of the partner
was known. To keep the decision independent of previous experience
with the different teams, we matched participants within teams. Therefore, this measure captures within-group social value orientation. Payoffs
were determined by one randomly chosen decision of the nine decisions
made by one randomly chosen player in each dyad. The decisions yielded
a social orientation angle for each participant, with~$0^{\circ}$
corresponding to selfishness, $45^{\circ}$ to pure altruism, and
negative angles to spitefulness.

After the fifth and final stage (a non-strategic and non-incentivised
collectivism measurement), participants learned their cumulative payoff in tokens and were paid in private.
%and final payment in New Israeli Shekels. 
One hundred and ninety two participants, recruited using ORSEE \citep*{greiner2015subject} participated in eight sessions conducted between June 2014 and January
2015. %Due to software malfunction in one session, the data from the AG sixth round were not saved. 
The experiment was programmed in z-Tree
\citep*{Fischbacher2007}. 
%The average payment was 72~NIS (approximately \$18) for a duration of 70~minutes

The key outcomes in this design are based on the allocation decisions made in the third stage. Direct and group reciprocity can be both positive and negative, and therefore are not hypothesized to have a systematic effect on the the amount allocated to either the TG partner or to his team mates. Nonetheless---while there is arguably no reason to discriminate between two neutral players---we hypothesize that direct and group reciprocity will lead the allocator to discriminate either for or against the TG partner or his team mates. Consequently, we predict that the absolute difference between the two allocations will be larger in all treatments compared to the baseline. This difference is measured in our `Discrimination' outcome.

We measure reciprocity directly by looking at the effect of the TG experience in the second stage on allocations made in the third stage. We define the experience with the TG partner in two ways. For responders, this is the amount sent to them by their partner. For senders, we calculate the amount returned to them by their partner as a fraction of the money available to the responder. Thus, an equal split of the pie implies a value of 1/2, and compensating the sender for his investment implies a value of 1/3. We subsequently define (direct or group) reciprocity as the slope of the allocation made to the TG partner or his team mates on the TG experience.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We report results on allocations, discrimination between recipients (measured as the
absolute difference between the two recipients' allocations), and direct and
group reciprocity. All reported statistical tests are based on mixed-effects
regressions with bootstrapped standard errors clustered on subjects. %See the supplementary material for the full specification and results.

The first column in Table~\ref{tab:results} presents the mean allocations.
Participants gave significantly more to members of their own team at the expense
of the neutral recipient ($z=3.58,p< 0.001$ for senders, 
$z=3.59,p< 0.001$ for
responders), establishing that our group formation manipulation was successful
in inducing group identity and triggering ingroup favouritism. Allocations to
the TG~partner and his team mates were not significantly different to the
baseline~35 ($p>0.43$ for all comparisons). This result suggests that the experience with the TG partner is, on average, neutral, such that positive and negative experiences balance each other overall.

Nonetheless, both positive and negative treatment of the TG partner or his team mates increase the absolute difference between the two allocationa. Indeed,
column of Table~\ref{tab:results} shows that allocators discriminated significantly more
than in the baseline both when interacting with their TG partner
($z=9.08,p< 0.001$) and with his team mates 
($z=3.93,p< 0.001$). This effect was not
significantly different between TG senders and receivers (F test $0.50,
p= 0.68$).

\subsection{Direct and group reciprocity}
\label{sec:reciprocity}

The third column of Table~\ref{tab:results}, \emph{Reciprocity}, reports the slope of
allocations regressed on the subjects' experience with their TG partners. 
The responder's experience with the sender is measured
as the share of the endowment that the sender chose to send. The sender's experience with the responder is measured as the share
of the received amount that the responder chose to send back. 
The sender's experience was not defined
for the six (out of 96) senders who did not send any money.

There is strong direct reciprocity: allocations
to the TG partners increase with the TG experience both for
senders ($z=3.06,p< 0.01$) and for responders 
($z=3.46,p< 0.001$).

Group reciprocity, however, is only observed for senders, who allocate
less to team mates of a responder who returned less---an intentionally harmful action.
Responders, on the other hand, although directly reciprocating the
TG partner's action, do not systematically discriminate against team mates
of a sender who sent little---a harmful action that does not unequivocally
signal a bad intention. The regression analysis shows no significant
effect of the responder's TG experience on her allocation to the sender's
team mates ($z=0.58,p= 0.56$). 
The sender's TG experience, on the other
hand, significantly increases the allocations made to the responder's team mates 
($z=3.29,p< 0.01$).
The estimated ratio of the group and direct reciprocity coefficients
is 50\%, so that for every allocation dollar a responder
loses due to an unkind action in the TG, his team mates lose~50 cents. 
This relationship is presented graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:plots} (the corresponding figure for direct reciprocity is included in the supplementary material).



% The median kindness of responders was $\frac{1}{3}$, which compensates senders
% exactly for the amount they sent. To compare the strength of ``positive'' and
% ``negative'' group reciprocity, we split senders by whether their TG partners
% sent less than $\frac{1}{3}$, exactly $\frac{1}{3}$ or more than $\frac{1}{3}$. The mean allocations in the
% group reciprocity condition for these three groups were give_ks3[1], give_ks3[2] and give_ks3[3]
% respectively. Those whose partners sent less than $\frac{1}{3}$ allocated significantly
% less than the other two groups (Mann-Whitney test at individual level, ), which were not significantly
% different from each other (XXX t test). Thus, behaviour is driven by negative
% group reciprocity. This accords with real world evidence: reports of negative
% reciprocity are much more widespread than for positive reciprocity.

Senders' group reciprocity was related to their social value orientation. The slope of the effect of the TG experience on allocations was 
15.97 for those with less than median SVO, and 
-1.06 for those with median or greater SVO 
(interaction, $p= 0.061$).These results should be interpreted cautiously, since both scores were 
affected by the TG experience.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our results show that upstream reciprocity is moderated by social boundaries. 
Humans respond to harms from outgroup members by discriminating against others 
in that specific outgroup. This supports the argument of \cite{Pietraszewski2016470} that group identity can modify the cost-benefit calculus of individuals deciding whether to extend a conflict. Unlike parochial altruism and within-group reciprocity, group reciprocity requires humans to differentiate between outgroups, possibly providing a cognitive basis for intergroup stereotyping and prejudice.

We distinguish between reciprocity towards harm and towards intentional harm
\citep{stanca2009testing}. People discriminate against others who harm them even
if the harmful action does not necessarily indicate bad intentions. However,
they only generalize to the perpetrator's  group members if the intentions
behind the harmful actions are unequivocally bad.

This observation raises new questions regarding the nature of reciprocity
and the role of intentions (or perceptions thereof). One possible
interpretation stems from the distinction between intention-based
and outcome-based motives in reciprocal behaviour \citep{falk2006theory}. It is
possible that humans generalize intentions across group members more than they generalize
actions across group members. So, if (e.g.)  group member 1 wishes to harm them,  they are prone to infer
that group member 2 also wishes to do so; but if group member 1 takes an action
that harms them, they do not necessarily infer that group member 2 would also
have done so. Indeed, the conjecture `One member of the Blue
group is a bad person, therefore all Blue members are bad' is plausible.
The conjecture `One member of the Blue group did not send any money,
therefore other Blue members did not send money' is not---as, given subjects' knowledge, the other
Blue members were not even necessarily senders.

% deals with point 5
Since our study was conducted with students from a rich industrialized democracy, results may not
generalize to all cultures \citep{henrich2010most}. In particular, the link between intentions
and moral judgment may vary across cultures \citep{barrett2016small}, and this could affect how group 
reciprocity plays out in different societies.

Upstream reciprocity is notoriously difficult to understand in evolutionary
terms \citep{boyd1989evolution,nowak2007upstream}. Group reciprocity
may provide another piece of the puzzle, as it provides two new channels
by which upstream reciprocity may evolve. First, group members are
interdependent, especially in the small groups that were the norm
during most of human evolutionary history. Punishing a perpetrator's
group member therefore indirectly harms the perpetrator, who is dependent
on his peers for, e.g., public goods provision. Thus, group reciprocity
may bridge upstream indirect reciprocity and direct reciprocity.

Second, the evolution of indirect reciprocity acts by way of chains
of reciprocal actions, which return with some probability to the original
instigator of the chain \citep{nowak2007upstream}. In a population
organised in groups, such that people interact more frequently with
their own group members, group reciprocity may increase the likelihood
of successful reciprocal chains, facilitating the evolution of upstream
reciprocity. These ideas could be formalized in future work.
