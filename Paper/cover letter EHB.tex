\noindent To the editors of \emph{Evolution and Human Behavior}
\bigskip


\noindent Dear editors,
\medskip

\noindent 

We hereby submit the manuscript ``Humans reciprocate intentional harm by discriminating against group peers'' for conisderation for publication in \emph{Evolution and Human Behavior}.
Sometimes humans take revenge, not on the person who harmed them, but on other people from that person's group. This can lead to intergroup conflict and violence. We ran a laboratory experiment showing that this happens. We found that humans only take revenge on groups when the original person's act was deliberate and unequivocal. Our results provide the first clean evidence for group based upstream reciprocity, and points at the boundaries of the phenomenon. We believe that group based upstream reciprocity is an important phenomenon underlying human cooperation and conflict, and is of interest to the readership of \emph{Evolution and Human Behavior}. We look forward to hearing from you.

\signature{Sincerely,}
