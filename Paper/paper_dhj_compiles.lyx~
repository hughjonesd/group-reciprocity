\begin_layout Abstract
Cycles of intergroup revenge appear in large scale conflicts.
 We experimentally test the hypothesis that humans practice group-based
 reciprocity: if someone harms or helps them, they harm or help other members
 of that person's group.
 Subjects played a trust game, then allocated money between other people.
 Senders whose partners returned more in the trust game gave more to that
 partner's group members.
 The effect was about 60 per cent of the size of the direct reciprocity
 effect.
 Receivers' allocations to group members did not depend on their partner's
 play, suggesting that group reciprocity was only triggered when the partner's
 intentions were unequivocal.

\begin_layout Abstract
The evolution of cooperation poses a puzzle to evolutionary and social scientist
s.
 Cooperation---by which individuals forgo personal benefits to aid others---is
 a hallmark of human uniqueness.
 However, there is a direct evolutionary pressure selecting against cooperators
 in favour of free riders, who can reap the societal benefits of cooperation
 without paying the costs.
 One mechanism that may underlie the evolution of cooperation is reciprocity
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nowak2006five,nowak2012evolving"

\end_inset

.
 Direct reciprocity increases the fitness of cooperators, as helping another
 individual leads to that individual reciprocating the help.
 In indirect reciprocity, individuals help or harm other people than those
 who have helped them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Indirect reciprocity comes in two flavours: 
\emph on
downstream
\emph default
 reciprocity follows the maxim `do unto thy neighbour as they have done
 to others', whereas 
\emph on
upstream
\emph default
 reciprocity follows the maxim `do unto thy neighbour as others have done
 unto you'.
 In this paper we study upstream indirect reciprocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "boyd1989evolution,nowak2005evolution,nowak2007upstream"

\end_inset

.
 Compared to downstream reciprocity, upstream reciprocity is simpler to
 implement, as it does not require tracking individual reputations, but
 is more difficult to understand from an evolutionary point of view 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "boyd1989evolution,nowak2005evolution"

\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, upstream reciprocity can co-evolve with direct or spatial
 reciprocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nowak2007upstream"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, laboratory experiments provide positive evidence for upstream
 reciprocity, as individuals are more generous to others if a third party
 was generous to them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dufwenberg2001direct,guth2001trust,greiner2005indirect"

\end_inset

, and the mere possibility of being harmed by a third party reduces cooperation
 in a social dilemma

\begin_layout Abstract
Here we examine group-based upstream reciprocity, or 
\emph on
group reciprocity
\emph default
.
 That is, an individual who is harmed (helped) by a member of an outgroup
 becomes more likely to harm (help) others from that group.
 Whereas group-based downstream reciprocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bernhard2006group,bernhard2006parochial"

\end_inset

 follows the maxim `do unto others as they have done to members of 
\emph on
my
\emph default
 tribe', group-based upstream reciprocity follows the maxim `do unto others
 as members of 
\emph on
their
\emph default
 tribe have done to me' (Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 Both kinds of motive can expand the scope of an individual-level conflict
 into an inter-group conflict.
 While (group-based) downstream reciprocity can bring a victim's groupmates
 in as retaliators, upstream reciprocity makes members of the aggressor's
 group into potential targets.
 Ethnic conflicts provide ample evidence that group identities play an important
 role in generalized reciprocity.
 Humans take revenge on outgroups as well as on individuals, as evidenced
 by the cycles of intergroup revenge that appear widespread in human conflict

Upstream group reciprocity also has different cognitive requirements from
 related phenomena.
 While in-group altruism and group-based downstream reciprocity require
 people to differentiate their own group from outsiders---

---and to keep a mental account of outgroups' reputation.
 Upstream group reciprocity could thus provide an evolutionary basis for

\begin_layout Abstract
We ran a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that people reciprocate
 towards groups.
 After an initial group-formation stage, participants interacted in two
 strategic stages.
 The first stage represented the upstream interaction, in which the individual
 could be helped by another person.
 We implemented this as a Trust Game (TG) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "berg1995trust"

\end_inset

, in which the Sender
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(S) receives
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

150 money-equivalent tokens, and chooses how many of them to send to the
 Responder
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(R).
 The amount sent is multiplied by a factor of
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

3, so that R receives between 0
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

450 tokens, of which he can send any number back to S.
 The TG enables us to model two types of interactions.
 Whereas R is clearly kind when returning money (and nasty when exploiting
 a generous proposer by keeping the received amount), S's intentions are
 equivocal.
 Sending money can be driven by selfish expectations of reciprocity, while
 not sending can be driven by caution.
 Thus,
\begin_inset space ~

R experiences kind or nasty 
\emph on
actions

, while
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S experiences kind or nasty actions and 
\emph on
intentions
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The second stage represented the reciprocal action, in which the individual
 could help others.
 We implemented this interaction as an allocation game, in which an allocator
 allocates a fixed amount between two recipients.
 In Direct Reciprocity rounds, the recipients included the TG partner; in
 Group Reciprocity rounds, a member of the TG partner's group; and in In-Group
 Favouritism rounds, a member of the allocator's group.
 The other recipient was always a member of a third, neutral, group.
 Baseline rounds included two neutral recipients, to test whether the TG
 experience lead allocators to discriminate in absence of any reciprocal
 or group motivations.

Each session consisted of
\begin_inset space ~

24 participants, who were randomly allocated into six groups of four.
 To distinguish from the groups in which participants interacted throughout
 the different stages of the experiment, we refer to the identity-relevant
 initial group as a 
\emph on
Team
\emph default
.
 Each participant was identified throughout the experiment by team colour
 and individual number (1--4) within the team.
 At the beginning of the experiment, we informed participants that the experimen
t has five distinct stages.
 In each stage, new groups are formed, and it is possible (though not necessary)
 that two participants will be in the same group in two different stages.
 The specific instructions for each stage were distributed and read aloud
 at the beginning of the stage.
 The five stage were a group formation stage, the TG stage, the AG stage,

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chen2009group"

\end_inset

, we created group identity in the first stage by allowing participants
 to consult each other using anonymous chat while solving a simple task.
 Participants solved five Raven matrices (see supplementary material).
 Each matrix was presented on screen for 120
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

seconds, during which each participant could both send written messages
 to the team and update her own answer.
 The final answer submitted at the end of the 120
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

seconds determined payoffs, with 10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

tokens paid for each correct answer.
 To further boost group identity through a common goal, team members each
 earned an additional bonus of 5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

tokens if all four team members answered correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Next, participants were rematched into pairs to play the one-shot TG.
 To facilitate understanding, participants played five practice rounds,
 in which they entered decisions both as
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S and as
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

R.
 In the actual interaction, participants could see their TG partner's team
 colour and individual number.
 The kindness of the Sender was measured as the share of the endowment sent,
 and of the Responder as the share of the received amount sent back.
 Responder's kindness was not defined for six (out of 96) responders whose
 partner did not send any money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The third stage consisted of six rounds.
 In each round, participants interacted in a group of three, identified
 by team colour and number.
 The allocation game was implemented as a random dictator game as follows.
 Each player in the group of three received 100
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

tokens to allocate within the group.
 The allocator received 30
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

tokens, and could freely allocate the remaining 70
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

tokens between the other two players.

Previous research found that people do not harm, but refrain from helping
 negatively perceived out-groups.
 Accordingly, we set the parameters of the game so that, compared to the
 reference point of the allocator's own share, an equal division benefits
 both other players.
 The matching scheme ensured that over the six rounds, each participant
 was in the same group of three exactly once with a member of her own team
 (treatment IG), once with her TG partner (Treatment DR), and twice with
 other members of the TG partner's team (treatment GR).
 The remaining two rounds served as the baseline (B) treatment.
 Note that the matching is not independent.
 For example, if one player is in treatment DR, than the other two are in
 treatments DR and either B or GR.
 No feedback was provided between rounds.
 The payoffs for this stage were determined by one randomly chosen round
 of the six rounds, and the allocation decision of one randomly chosen player
 in each group.

The fourth stage implemented the slider measure of social value orientation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, in which participants choose nine allocations between themselves and another
 person.
 For consistency with the previous stages, the team identity of the partner
 was known.
 To keep the decision independent of previous experience with the different
 teams, we matched participants within teams.
 Consistently with the notion of humans as parochial altruists, we believe
 that such in-group allocations best reflect social preferences

 Allocations to the TG partners increase with that partner's kindness both

\begin_layout Abstract
Group reciprocity, however, is only observed for senders, who allocate less
 to team mates of a responder who failed to at least compensate the sender
 for the amount sent---a clear signal of bad intentions.
 Responders, on the other hand, although directly reciprocating the TG partner,
 do not systematically discriminate against team mates of a sender who sent
 little---an unkind action that does not unequivocally signals a bad intention.
 The regression analysis shows no significant effect of sender kindness
 on responder's allocation to the sender's team mates (
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.86,p=0.391$
\end_inset

).
 The responder's kindness, on the other hand, significantly increases allocation
s made to his team mates (
\begin_inset Formula $z=2.02,p<0.05$
\end_inset

).
 The estimated ratio of the group and direct reciprocity coefficients is
 0.63, implying that for every allocation dollar that the responder loses
 due to an unkind action in the TG, his team mates lose

63 cents.

I'm not really comfortable with the discussion yet.
 The action/intention distinction, which is certainly plausible, is not
 completely proven by our result.
 If we make it the centrepiece of the conclusion, then we may be setting
 ourselves up to be shot down.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I know, we need a non-obvious result to talk about! One solution is to say
 that we open the door to further study of the roots of conflict.
 That's a bit weak, though.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another solution is maybe to do a second experiment.
 I had an idea: could we show that this motive actually can lead to a full-blown
 intergroup conflict?

Our results show

 that upstream reciprocity is moderated by social boundaries.
 We distinguish between two types of reciprocity: reciprocated actions and
 reciprocated intentions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 People discriminate against others who harm them even if the harmful action
 does not necessarily indicate bad intentions.
 However, they only generalize to the perpetrator's  group members if the
 intentions behind the harmful actions are unequivocally bad.

\begin_layout Abstract
This observation raises new questions regarding the nature of reciprocity
 and the role of intentions (or perceptions thereof).
 One possible interpretation stems from the distinction between intention-based
 and outcome-based motives in reciprocal behaviour

 Whereas intention-based reciprocity is plausibly generalisable

explain why.
 This is my attempt:
\end_layout

\end_inset

, i.e.
 subjects may wish to punish there is no reason to generalize outcome-based
 reciprocity to group members who don't share the outcome.
 The notion of outcome-based reciprocity is also related to that of restorative
 justice.
 A desire to equalize earnings given the TG behaviour in the experiment
 can motivate discrimination against a misbehaving TG partner, but not his
 fellow group members.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
A related distinction is between actions and types.
 Stereotypical thinking can easily lead people to generalise types, whereas
 generalisation of actions is nonsensical.
 The conjecture `One member of the Blue group is a bad person, therefore
 all Blue members are bad' is plausible.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why? Presumably if you think one member of Blue is bad, as evidenced by
 their failure to return money; and you generalize this to other members
 of Blue being bad; then you also expect those members not to return money.
 I.e.
 the second conjecture is implied by the first.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The conjecture `One member of the Blue group did not send any money, therefore
 other Blue members did not send money' is not---as the other Blue members
 did not even necessarily face the choice of how much to send as a sender.

Upstream reciprocity is notoriously difficult to understand in evolutionary
 terms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Group reciprocity may provide another piece of the puzzle, as it provides
 two new channels by which upstream reciprocity may evolve.
 First, group members are interdependent, especially in the small groups
 that were the norm during most of human evolutionary history.
 Punishing a perpetrator's group member therefore indirectly harms the perpetrat
or, who is dependent on his peers for, e.g., public goods provision.
 Thus, group reciprocity may bridge upstream indirect reciprocity and direct
 reciprocity.

Second, the evolution of indirect reciprocity acts by way of chains of reciproca
l actions, which return with some probability to the original instigator
 of the chain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nowak2007upstream"

\end_inset

.
 In a population organised in groups, such that people interact more frequently
 with their own group members, group reciprocity may increase the likelihood
 of successful reciprocal chains, facilitating the evolution of upstream
 reciprocity.
 We aim to explore these ideas in future work.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, we thought of it also as generalising types.
 It doesn't make sense to punish Blue 2 for an action that he didn't do
 (Blue 1 did).
 The generalisation of if Blue 1 did something than all Blues did it is
 clearly nonsensical.
 But if the motivation is to punish bastards, it makes some sense to generalise
 that all blues are bastards (well, 63% percent they are :P), and therefore
 I should punish all of them.
