\begin{abstract}
Cycles of intergroup revenge appear in large scale conflicts. We experimentally
test the hypothesis that humans practice group-based reciprocity:
if someone harms or helps them, they harm or help other members of
that person's group. Subjects played a trust game, then allocated
money between other people. Senders whose partners returned more in
the trust game gave more to that partner's group members. The effect
was about 60 per cent of the size of the direct reciprocity effect.
Receivers' allocations to group members did not depend on their partner's
play, suggesting that group reciprocity was only triggered when the
partner's intentions were unequivocal.

\section{Introduction}

The evolution of cooperation poses a puzzle to evolutionary and social
scientists. Cooperation---by which individuals forgo personal benefits
to aid others---is a hallmark of human uniqueness. On the other hand,
there is a direct evolutionary pressure selecting against cooperators
in favour of free riders. One mechanism that may underlie the evolution
of cooperation is reciprocity \cite{nowak2006five}. Direct reciprocity
increases the fitness of cooperators, as helping another individual
leads to that individual reciprocating the help. In indirect reciprocity,
individuals help or harm other people than those who have helped them.

Evidence suggests that human social behaviour, including cooperation
and reciprocity, is bounded by social groups \cite{tajfel1979integrative,yamagishi2000thegroup,balliet2014ingroup,DeDreu2014}.
Humans cooperate more with, and reciprocate more towards members of
their group \cite{chen2009group,chen2011potential}; and they punish
norm violators more who harm a member of their own group \cite{bernhard2006group,bernhard2006parochial}.

Group identities may also affect reciprocity in another way: humans
take revenge on outgroups as well as on individuals. Cycles of intergroup
revenge appear widespread in human conflict \cite{horowitz2001thedeadly,horowitz1985ethnicgroups,chagnon1988lifehistories,shayo2010judicial}.
Surprisingly little work has examined this motivation. \footnote{Existing experiments are suggestive but lack material incentives \cite{stenstrom2008theroles},
cannot distinguish direct from group-based reciprocity \cite{gaertner2008whenrejection}
or cannot rule out strategic motives \cite{hugh-jones2013intergroup}.
\cite{aureli1992kinoriented}examines kin-oriented reciprocity among
Japanese macaques. }

Indirect reciprocity comes in two flavours; \emph{downstream} reciprocity
follows the principle of `do unto thy neighbour as they have done
to others', whereas \emph{upstream} reciprocity follows the principle
of `do unto thy neighbour as others have done unto you'. In this paper
we study upstream indirect reciprocity \cite{boyd1989evolution,nowak2005evolution,nowak2007upstream}.
Compared to downstream reciprocity, upstream reciprocity is simpler
to implement, as it does not require tracking individual reputations,
but is more difficult to understand from an evolutionary point of
view \cite{boyd1989evolution,nowak2005evolution}. Nonetheless, upstream
reciprocity can co-evolve with direct or spatial reciprocity\cite{nowak2007upstream}.
Laboratory experiments provide positive evidence for upstream reciprocity,
as individuals are more generous to others if a third party was generous
to them \cite{dufwenberg2001direct,guth2001trust,greiner2005indirect},
and the mere possibility of being harmed by a third party reduces
cooperation in a social dilemma \cite{weisel2016social}. Here we
examine group-based upstream reciprocity, or \emph{group reciprocity}.
That is, an individual who is harmed (helped) by a member of an outgroup
becomes more likely to harm (help) others from that group.

We ran a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that people
reciprocate in groups. After an initial group-formation stage, participants
interacted in two strategic stages. The first stage represented the
upstream interaction, in which the individual could be helped by another
person. We implemented this as a Trust Game (TG) \cite{berg1995trust},
in which the Sender~(S) receives~150 money-equivalent tokens, and
chooses how many of them to send to the Responder~(R). The amount
sent is multiplied by a factor of~3, so that R receives between 0~and~450
tokens, of which he can send any number back to S. The TG enables
us to model two types of interactions. Whereas R is clearly kind when
returning money (and nasty when exploiting a generous proposer by
keeping the received amount), S's intentions are equivocal. Sending
money can be driven by selfish expectations of reciprocity, while
not sending can be driven by caution. Thus,~R experiences kind or
nasty \emph{actions}, while~S experiences kind or nasty actions and
\emph{intentions}.

% upstream, not downstream, right:?The second stage represented the
reciprocal action, in which the individual could help others. We implemented
this interaction as an allocation game (AG), in which an allocator
allocates a fixed amount between two recipients. In direct reciprocity
(DR) rounds, the recipients included the TG partner; in group reciprocity
(GR) rounds, a member of the TG partner's group; and in in-group favouritism
(IF) rounds, a member of the allocator's group. The other recipient
was always a member of a third, neutral, group. Baseline (B) rounds
included two neutral recipients, to test whether the TG experience
lead allocators to discriminate in absence of any reciprocal or group
motivations.

The allocation decisions revealed that reciprocating intentions generalizes
to groups. The effect of group-based upstream reciprocity was approximately
63\% of that of direct reciprocity. Although we found strong evidence
for direct reciprocity of actions, this did not generalize to the
group level. Allocations favoured in-group members, indicating that
our group manipulation was successful.

\section{Method}

\label{sec:design}

Each session consisted of~24 participants, who were randomly allocated
to six groups of four. To distinguish from the groups in which participants
interacted throughout the different stages of the experiment, we refer
to the identity-relevant initial group as a \emph{Team}. Each participant
was identified throughout the experiment by team colour and individual
number (1--4) within the team. At the beginning of the experiment,
we informed participants that the experiment has five distinct stages.
In each stage, new groups are formed, and it is possible (though not
necessary) that two participants will be in the same group in two
different stages. The specific instructions for each stage were distirbuted
and read aloud at the beginning of the stage. The five stage were
a group formation stage, the TG stage, the AG stage, a social value
orientation elicitation \citep*{murphy2011measuring} stage and a
collectivism scale measurement \citep*[adapted from the horizontal collectivism scale in]{Singelis1995horizontal}.

Following \citet*{chen2009group}, we created group identity in the
first stage by allowing participants to consult each other using anonymous
chat when solving a simple task. Participants solved five Raven matrices
(see supplementary material). Each matrix was presented on screen
for 120~seconds, during which each participant could both send written
messages to the team and update her own answer. The final answer submitted
at the end of the 120~seconds determined payoffs, with 10~tokens
paid for each ocrrect answer. To further boost group identity through
a common goal, an additional bonus of 5~tokens was earned if all
four team members answered correctly.

Next, participants were rematched into pairs to play the one-shot
TG. To facilitate understanding, participants played five practice
rounds, in which they entered decisions both as~S and as~R. In the
actual interaction, participants could see their TG partner's team
colour and individual number. The kindness of the Sender was measured
as the share of the endowment sent, and of the Responder as the share
of the received amount sent back. Responder's kindness was not defined
for six (out of 96) responders whose partner did not send any money.

The third stage consisted of six rounds. In each round, participants
interacted in a group of three, identified by team colour and number.
The allocation game was implemented as a random dictator game as follows.
Each player in the group of three received 100~tokens to allocate
within the group. The allocator received 30~tokens, and could freely
allocate the remaining 70~tokens between the other two players. Previous
research found that people do not harm, but refrain from helping negatively
perceived out-groups. Accordingly, we set the parameters of the game
such that, compared to the reference point of the allocator's own
share, an equal division benefits both other players. The matching
scheme ensured that over the six rounds, each participant was in the
same group of three exactly once with a member of her own team (treatment
IG), once with her TG partner (Treatment DR), and twice with other
members of the TG partner's team (treatment GR). The remaining two
rounds served as the baseline (B) treatment. For example. Note that
the matching is not independent. For example, if one player is in
treatment DR, than the other two are in treatments Dr and either B
or GR. No feedback was provided between rounds. The payoffs for this
stage were determined by one randomly chosen round of the six rounds,
and the allocator decision of one randomly chosen player in each group.

The fourth stage implemented the slider measure \citep*{murphy2011measuring,crosetto2012flexible},
in which participants choose nine allocations between themselves and
another person. For consistency with the previous stages, the team
identity of the partner was known. To keep the decision independent
of previous experience with the different teams, we matched participants
within teams. Consistent with the notion of humans as parochial altruists,
we believe that such in-group allocations best reflect social preferences.
Payoffs were determined by one randomly chosen decision of the nine
decisions made by one randomly chosen player in each dyad. The decisions
yielded for each participant a social orientation angle, with~$0^{\circ}$
corresponding to selfishness, $45^{\circ}$ to pure altruism, and
negative angles to spitefulness.

After the fifth and final stage of non-strategic and non-incentivised
collectivism measurement, participants learned of their cumulative
payoff in tokens, and final payment in New Israeli Shekels. One hundred
and ninety two participants, recruited using ORSEE \citep*{greiner2015subject}
participated in eight sessions conducted between June 2014 and January
2015. Due to software malfunction in one session, the data from the
AG sixth round were not saved. The experiment was programmed in z-Tree
\citep*{Fischbacher2007}. The average payment was 72~NIS (approximately
\$18) for a duration of 70~minutes.

\section{Results}

\label{sec:results}

We report results on allocations, discrimination between recipients,
and direct and group reciprocity. All reported statistical tests are
based on mixed-effects regressions with robust standard errors clustered
on subjects. See the supplementary material for the full specification
and results.

Figure~\ref{fig:allocations} presents the mean allocations. Participants
gave significantly more to members of their own team at the expense
of the neutral recipient ($\beta=6.76,p<0.001$ for senders, $\beta=4.25,p<0.005$),
establishing that our group formation manipulation was successful
in inducing group identity and triggering in-group favouritism. Allocations
to the TG~partner and his team mates were not significantly different
to the baseline~35 ($p>0.440$ for all comparisons). Nonetheless,
allocators discriminated significantly more than in the baseline both
when interacting with their TG partner ($\beta=19.18,p<0.001$) and
with his team mates ($\beta=4.04,p<0.001$. The interaction of the
identity of the recipient and the allocator's TG role (sender or reciever)
was not significant ($\chi^{2}=1.42,p=0.700$).

neutral-team recipient. }

\subsection*{Direct and group reciprocity}

\label{sec:reciprocity}

Figure~\ref{fig:reciprocity} presents the allocations made in the
DR and GR conditions separated by the whether the kindness of the
action of the TG partner was below the median or not. The median kindness
of the senders was~$\frac{1}{2}$ (median transfer of~75 out of~150
tokens). The median kindness of the responders was~$\frac{1}{3}$
(median share returned matches the amount sent). The figure reveals
strong direct reciprocity. Senders allocate less than the baseline~35
tokens to responders who failed to at least compensate the sender
for the amount sent. Responders both allocate more than~35 tokens
to senders who sent at least half their endowment, and less to those
who sent less. These observations are confirmed by the regression
analysis. Allocations to the TG partners increase with that partner's
kindness both for senders ($\beta=13.89,p=0.080$ and for responders
($\beta=15.17,p<0.001$).

Group reciprocity, however, is only observed for senders, who allocate
less to team mates of a responder who failed to at least compensate
the sender for the amount sent---a clear signal of bad intentions.
Responders, on the other hand, although directly reciprocating the
TG partner, do not systematically discriminate against team mates
of a sender who sent little---an unkind action that does not unequivocally
signals a bad intention. The regression analysis shows no significant
effect of sender kindness on responder's allocation to the sender's
team mates ($\beta=0.01,p=0.391$). The responder's kindness, on the
other hand, significantly increases allocations made to his team mates
($\beta=8.76,p<0.05$). The estimated ratio of the group and direct
reciprocity coefficients is 0.63, implying that for every allocation
dollar that the responder loses due to an unkind action in the TG,
his team mates lose~63 cents.

more (less) to senders who sent more (less) then the median (equal
to exactly half the endowment)---but do not generalize to the sender's
team mates. Senders give less to responders who returned less than
the median (equal to exactly $\frac{1}{3}$, i.e., the amount sent)
and their team mates. }

\section{Discussion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

Our results suggest that upstream reciprocity is moderated by social
boundaries. We distinguish between two types of reciprocity: reciprocated
actions and reciprocated intentions \citep{stanca2009testing}.
